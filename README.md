# EXP 4 Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques- Lab Scenario: Smart Health Assistant System
# Description: 
## Background:
You are part of a development team working on an AI-based Smart Health Assistant named "MediGuide" that assists elderly patients in managing chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis. The assistant must provide tailored health advice, medication reminders, daily tips, and emotional support through natural language conversations.

## Objective:
Develop a scenario-based report that demonstrates how diverse prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based, and multi-modal prompts) can be used to optimize MediGuide’s responses in different use cases.

Prompting Techniques
1.Zero-Shot Prompting
Zero-Shot prompting is a technique where the AI is given a task or question without any prior examples or contextual cues. It relies entirely on the AI’s pre-trained knowledge and general understanding of the topic. For example, when asked, “Explain how a smart irrigation system using Arduino works,” the AI generates a basic explanation using its knowledge of Arduino and soil moisture sensors. The typical response includes simple points like the sensor detecting soil moisture levels and the Arduino activating a water pump when the soil is dry.
This method is fast and efficient, as it requires minimal input from the user. It is especially useful when users are looking for a quick summary or general idea. However, the response may lack technical accuracy, organization, and specificity. It does not usually include deeper aspects like sensor calibration, circuit integration, or power management. As a result, while Zero-Shot prompting is useful for basic understanding, it may not meet the needs of users who require structured explanations or professional-level insights.
Its main advantage is convenience—it’s simple and immediate. However, its primary limitation is the lack of control over the response structure and depth. The AI might omit crucial steps or oversimplify complex processes, which can be a drawback in educational or technical contexts. Therefore, Zero-Shot prompting is best suited for beginners or non-technical audiences who seek a high-level overview.
2. Few-Shot Prompting
Few-Shot prompting involves providing the AI with one or more examples of the desired response format before asking the main question. This technique helps the AI understand the structure, tone, and level of detail expected in the answer. For instance, before asking “Explain how a smart irrigation
system using Arduino works,” an example might be given: “In a temperature control system, a sensor detects heat and sends the signal to a microcontroller, which then activates a fan.” The AI uses this pattern to model its own response, ensuring consistency in format and logic.
The resulting explanation is generally more detailed, well-structured, and easier to follow. The AI learns to include important elements such as input sensing, data processing, and output actions. In the context of a smart irrigation system, it would explain how the soil moisture sensor sends data to the Arduino, which then processes it and triggers a relay to turn on a water pump. The response is more complete and logically ordered than in Zero-Shot prompting.
Few-Shot prompting is particularly helpful in academic and instructional environments where clear formatting and consistency are important. It guides the AI to follow a narrative style, making the output ideal for reports, documentation, and learning materials. However, this technique requires more effort from the user to prepare relevant examples beforehand.
The main strength of Few-Shot prompting is its ability to bridge the gap between simplicity and technical depth by guiding the AI toward a preferred structure. This makes it suitable for learners, educators, and professionals who require accuracy and clarity without overly technical jargon.
3. Role-Based Prompting
Role-Based prompting is a powerful technique where the AI is instructed to assume the identity of a professional or expert in a specific field. For example, the prompt “You are an embedded systems engineer. Explain how a smart irrigation system using Arduino and a soil moisture sensor works” transforms the AI’s perspective, prompting it to use professional-level language and insights. The response tends to include specific technical components, such as sensor calibration, analog-to-digital conversion, relay control, power optimization, and code logic.
This method results in the most detailed and technically accurate responses of all prompting types. The AI may discuss aspects like voltage thresholds for sensor input, integration of modules with the Arduino board, the use of transistors or MOSFETs for switching, and writing embedded C/C++ code to manage sensor input and control timing. It may also explain how to handle noise filtering and power supply considerations for field deployment.
Role-Based prompting is ideal for professional or academic audiences who expect a high degree of detail and precision. It’s especially useful for generating technical reports, engineering documentation, or research summaries. By framing the task from an expert’s viewpoint, the AI is more likely to focus on the practical and theoretical considerations that go into designing and implementing the system.
While this technique produces high-quality content, it assumes the user understands the professional role and can formulate prompts accordingly. It’s not always suitable for beginners due to the complexity of the language and ideas presented. Nonetheless, for technical users, Role-Based prompting is the best choice for producing expert-level content.
Output Difference
The differences in the outputs produced by these techniques are noticeable in several aspects: depth, clarity, structure, and technical detail. Zero-Shot prompting offers a brief overview suitable for general understanding but lacks nuanced explanation. FewShot prompting introduces consistency and formatting, making the information easier to digest and follow, especially for educational purposes. In contrast, Role-Based prompting significantly elevates the complexity and precision of the response, making it ideal for professional use cases where domain expertise is expected. The choice of technique thus directly affects how well the AI meets the user’s requirements.
Conclusion
This experiment highlights that each prompting technique has its strengths depending on the task's objective and the user’s expectations. Zero-Shot prompting is ideal for quick, high-level overviews with minimal setup. Few-Shot prompting is more appropriate when structured and coherent responses are needed, especially in academic or tutorial contexts. Role-Based prompting is best for in-depth technical or professional scenarios where subject expertise must be reflected. By understanding and applying the appropriate prompting technique, users can better harness the capabilities of AI to meet specific informational or instructional goals.



# Result
The results of the experiment demonstrate that the choice of prompting strategy plays a crucial role in shaping the AI’s output. Zero-Shot prompting is fast and requires no additional setup, but it often lacks detail. Few-Shot prompting encourages better organization and yields structured responses that are easier to interpret. Role-Based prompting enables a professional tone and detailed content, simulating the depth and language of an expert in the field. These findings confirm that being intentional about prompt design can significantly enhance the quality of AI-generated content.
